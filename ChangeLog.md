# Changelog for [hledger-flow](https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow)

## 0.13.1

- Automatically add [include lines for yearly price files](https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/#price-files) if they are present on disk.
- Minor report changes - do not assume too many extra options for default reports.

## 0.13.0

- Add an experimental rundir option for imports

The experimental rundir is an attempt to restrict hledger-flow into processing just a subset of files, primarily to quickly get feedback/failures while adding new accounts to an existing set of accounts.

The use case has been described in [issue 64](https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/64).

It is experimental, because the only problem it currently solves is getting hledger-flow to fail fast.
One of the current side effects of doing so is that the generated include files are then written to only 
include the subset of files that were processed.

But as soon as you do a full run again, the include files will be correctly re-generated as before.

## 0.12.4.0

- Update usage of hledger to reflect updated command-line flags of hledger version 1.15
  https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/73
- Compile with stackage lts-14.9

## 0.12.3.1

Fixed a bug where:

Given:
- A run of `hledger-flow import`

When:
- specifying a relative import base directory
- but specifically without any relative prefixes such as `./` or `../`

Then:
- the account-level include files pointing to the real journal entries would have incorrect paths

https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/65

## 0.12.3

Add more reports:

- Balance Sheet per owner per year, and for all owners per year
- Unknown transactions per owner per year
- A transfer balance overview per year

## 0.12.2.1

Fix resolver extraction and hledger-flow --version in release-tarball script

## 0.12.2

Slightly smarter reporting.

- Get the available report years for each individual owner. Only generate reports for those years.
- Create uniform output directories.
- Add system info to version output

## 0.12.1

Generate some reports per owner.

Report generation is still a work-in-progress.

https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/pull/57

## 0.12.0

- Re-organised the command-line interface:
  moved various command-line options out of subcommands, into the top-level.
- Added a [contributor's agreement](https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org)
  after receiving some more valued contributions from
  [jecaro](https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/pull/42)

## 0.11.3

- Detect the hledger-flow base directory correctly, even when in a subdirectory. Similar to how git behaves.
- Change the version subcommand into a flag - thanks to [jecaro](https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/pull/38) for the contribution.

## 0.11.2

- Improved display of external process output

## 0.11.1.2

- Exit with an error code when any external script fails - https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/28
- Capture external process output when doing parallel processing, in order to better prevent mangled concurrent output.
- Allow users to specify a path to an hledger executable
- Display a user-friendly error message if hledger cannot be found - https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/22

## 0.11.1.1

- Support input files from the year 2011 - https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/27
  Use a more specific input-file pattern, so as not to match 2011-include.journal
- Print command-line options if requested - https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/11
- Use the channel output functions consistently to avoid concurrency issues.

## 0.11.1

- Create statically linked executables on Linux - https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/releases
- Add an option to disable parallel processing
- Log the exit status of shell commands.
- Upgrade to LTS 13.16 for GHC 8.6.4.

## 0.11

- Change the name from `hledger-makeitso` to `hledger-flow`.

## 0.10

- Add a `version` subcommand.
  Create [issue #15](https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/15)
  to change it into a `--version` flag later.
- Fix a minor issue where yearly include files were generated at the top-level
  of the directtory structure, even though the same content was available in the
  `import` directory.
  The top-level `all-years.journal` now just includes the years within the
  `import` directory.
- Upgrade to LTS 13.15 for GHC 8.6.4
- Add CircleCI and TravisCI build instructions. Switch the README.org to a
  README.md in order to better support CI status badges.


## 0.9.0.1

First hackage release. Minor changes to fix `stack sdist` warnings and errors, in preperation of
the hackage upload.

1bf817c "Merge pull request #9 from apauley/hackage-upload" Mar 31 21:51:38 2019 +0200

## 0.9

Process all statements in parallel.

This has a significant speed improvement on multi-processor machines when dealing with lots of input files.

## 0.8

Generate an all-years.journal on each level which includes all the available years for that level. Replace the old makeitso.journal with the top-level version of this:

## 0.7

Change the way include files are aggregated.

It used to be by owner/bank/account, now each of those levels (owner/bank/account) are aggregated per year:
