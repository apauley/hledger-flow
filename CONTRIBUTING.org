** Getting Started
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:

*** Get The Project
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: get-the-project
    :END:

If you don't already have one, sign up for a free
[[https://github.com/join][Github Account]].

After you [[https://github.com/login][log into]] Github using your
account, go to the [[https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow][Hledger Flow Project Page]], and click on [[https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/fork][Fork]] to fork the
Hledger Flow repository into your own account.

Once you have forked the repository, you can now clone your forked
repository to your own machine, so you have a complete copy of the
project and can begin safely making your modifications.

To clone your forked repository, first make sure you have installed
[[https://git-scm.com/downloads][Git]], the version control system used
by Github. Then open a Terminal and type the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mkdir hledger-flow
    cd hledger-flow
    git clone git@github.com:apauley/hledger-flow.git .
#+END_SRC

This repository has some submodules included, mostly related to the
examples in the documentation.

You need to initialise and update the submodules:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
#+END_SRC

*** Build the Project
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: build-the-project
    :END:

You need a recent version of [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][stack]] installed.

Then run:

#+NAME: build-script
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ./bin/build-and-test
#+END_SRC

Which should end with this:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
    Copied executables to ~/.local/bin:
    - hledger-flow
#+END_SRC

Ensure that =${HOME}/.local/bin= is in your =PATH=.

Usually this means adding this to your =~/.bashrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"
#+END_SRC

*** Find an Issue
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: find-an-issue
    :END:

You may have your own idea about what contributions to make to Hledger
Flow, which is great! If you want to make sure the Hledger Flow
contributors are open to your idea, you can
[[https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/new][open an issue]]
first on the Hledger Flow project site.

Otherwise, if you have no ideas about what to contribute, you can find a
list of issues on the project's [[https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues][issue tracker]].

Issues are tagged with various labels, such as =good first issue= or
=help wanted=, which can help you find issues that are a fit for you.

If some issue is confusing or you think you might need help, then just
post a comment on the issue asking for help.

Once you've decided on an issue and understand what is necessary to
complete the issue, then it's a good idea to post a comment on the issue
saying that you intend to work on it. Otherwise, someone else might work
on it too!

*** Create a Pull Request
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: create-a-pull-request
    :END:

To create a pull request, first push all your changes to your fork of
the project repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git push
#+END_SRC

Next, [[https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/compare][open a new pull request]] on Github, and select /Compare Across Forks/.
On the right hand side, choose your own fork of the Hledger Flow repository,
in which you've been making your contribution.

Provide a description for the pull request, which details the issue it
is fixing, and has other information that may be helpful to developers
reviewing the pull request.

Finally, click /Create Pull Request/!

*** Get Your Pull Request Merged
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: get-your-pull-request-merged
    :END:

Once you have a pull request open, it's still your job to get it merged!
To get it merged, a core contributor has to approve the code.

Code reviews can sometimes take a few days, because open source projects
are largely done outside of work, in people's leisure time. Be patient,
but don't wait forever. If you haven't gotten a review within a few
days, then consider gently reminding people that you need a review.

Once you receive a review, you will probably have to go back and make
minor changes that improve your contribution and make it follow existing
conventions in the code base. This is normal, even for experienced
contributors, and the rigorous reviews help ensure that the quality of
the code stays high.

After you make changes, you may need to remind reviewers to check out
the code again. If they give a final approval, it means your code is
ready for merge!

If you don't get a merge in a day after your review is successful, then
please gently remind folks that your code is ready to be merged.
